wtf:to send images or file need send it with new FormData() function way if not submiting form and using only input fields, or else use forms


Wtf:sending array of strings with new FormData() method to server but get array with single value from server . wtf.

ans:Based on the server-side code snippet you provided, it appears the issue isn't with how files (images) are handled, but rather with how arrays within the form data (such as color and size) are submitted and interpreted. When using FormData to append array elements and then sending this data over HTTP, the server might interpret these appended elements differently than expected, potentially combining them into a single string.

d: no matter what file you r sending , it can only be sent using new FormData() instance, append your data in it send it to server,
    then use mutler to seprate strings and files and save in database.


wtf: cannot call function in jsx only varible or you stuck in loading




wtf:{props.images && props.images.map(... 
    works in code but {props.images.map(.... dont work even prop.images.length is not zero why


oh: if there is problem in child component 
    if child component is not rendering then whole parent will not excute 
    ans:This is because React's default behavior upon encountering an error during rendering 
    is to stop executing the component function and propagate the error up the component tree.
    If the error is not caught and handled (for instance, with error boundaries),
    it can result in parts of the UI not appearing as expected, or in the worst case, an entirely blank page.


big f: there was time when we use to acess element css using ref.current.style.css  and css was written with classes in seprate file , 
now when we want to modify css with state , it say you can only acess inline style of css with ref.current.style.elementcss to acess css of file or get css any way in the end use getcomputedcss 

now it feels like react and javascript is big mind f, more than c++ atleast  we know what we were doing in c++
